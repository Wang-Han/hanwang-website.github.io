abstract: In the era of big data(BD), there are countless data generated every day, and the amount is still growing. With the in-depth promotion of BD technology, it has also provided considerable contributions to security risk management. Electric power engineering(PE) construction site data has a great impact on safety risks, so we must pay attention to the analysis and utilization of these data. The purpose of this article is to study the safety risk management system(SRMS) in the construction of electric power projects in the context of BD. This article first analyzes the shortcomings of the existing SRMS in electric power construction, and elaborates on the advantages of BD technology. According to the actual application of BD technology in electric power construction safety, it explains the safety risks of BD technology in electric power construction. Applicability and feasibility in the management system. From the perspective of risk management, this paper identifies and analyzes the safety risk factors that affect the construction of electric power projects, and uses BD technology to preprocess and analyze the data collected on the spot. The experimental research results show that the construction personnel have the greatest impact on safety, with a risk factor of 34.51%, followed by the construction environment, with a risk factor of 29.12%. Therefore, it is necessary to strengthen the professional skills and safety awareness of construction personnel, analyze the construction environment, and remove hidden safety hazards.
