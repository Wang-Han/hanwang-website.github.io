    description: "Worked on 3D simulation and simulation intelligence for autonomous driving. Research, design and implement algorithms in multiple domains including sensor simulation, agent behavior, and vehicle dynamics, in order to make a simulation of the ego car and agents more realistic. 
    
    
    Led another two engineers developing sensor simulation, which generates synthetic scenarios' 3D point cloud data scanned by simulated LiDAR based on physics-based ray casting and PBR material rendering. This project led to a 38% increase in mAP@iou_0.5 for our LiDAR detection model."
